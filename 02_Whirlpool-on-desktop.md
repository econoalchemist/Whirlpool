# Whirlpool On Desktop With RoninDojo
This section will demonstrate how to use Whirlpool on desktop with the Whirlpool GUI configured to run with your own Bitcoin full node, the Tanto by [RoninDojo](https://ronindojo.io/).

# Connecting
Connecting the Tanto is very simple:

- Plug one end of an Ethernet cable into the back of the Tanto.
- Plug the other end of the Ethernet cable into your router or switch.
- Plug in the power adaptor.

Next, just plug one end of the power cable for the included power supply into your outlet and the other end into the transformer.

The Tanto will automatically power on and start the initial configuration process. Ensure that the power is not interrupted during the automatic initial configuration process. This process takes roughly 10 minutes and you will notice the red light illuminate underneath the Tanto once this process is finished. Then, you will be ready to login to the Tanto through the web interface.
