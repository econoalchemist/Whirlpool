# Whirlpool On Desktop With RoninDojo
This section will demonstrate how to use Whirlpool on desktop with the Whirlpool GUI configured to run with your own Bitcoin full node, the Tanto by [RoninDojo](https://ronindojo.io/).

If you are not running your own Bitcoin node then you are trusting someone else's. RoninDojo is a FOSS developer team focused exclusively on building the most stable and tailored full node for [Samourai Wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com/) support. With Samourai Wallet and RoninDojo combined, users are empowered with a mobile-first Bitcoin wallet that features privacy-enhancing tools like a Whirlpool CoinJoin implementation and post-mix collaborative spending tools; all powered by the user's own self-hosted Bitcoin full node communicating with the mobile client over Tor. This guide demonstrates setting up a new plug & play full Bitcoin node from [RoninDojo](https://ronindojo.io/) called the Tanto.

The Tanto will automatically power on and start the initial configuration process. Ensure that the power is not interrupted during the automatic initial configuration process. This process takes roughly 10 minutes and you will notice the red light illuminate underneath the Tanto once this process is finished. Then, you will be ready to login to the Tanto through the web interface.
