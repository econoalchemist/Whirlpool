## A Real-World Example:
Before diving into how Whirlpool works, it is helpful to understand the implications of a fully transparant transaction ledger in the face of an ever increasing adversarial environment. This section will provide that background with a real-world example and an explaination of how bitcoin transactions are scrutinized in such a scenario using a ficticious character, Alice, to preserve the privacy of those actually involved.

Take the recent Canadian Freedom Convoy for instance, here is a timeline of actual events with a hypothetical character, Alice, to preserve the privacy of anyone who actually participated.

- January 28, 2022: Truckers start arriving in Ottawa, ON
- February 1, 2022: [@HonkHonkHodl](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl) receives first bitcoin donation via [@tallycoinapp](https://twitter.com/tallycoinapp). ([Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl/status/1488625113406717952?s=20&t=3OffQxFJg4Y0qIy9vi_RAg)). Not many people were using Bitcoin to donate to the Freedom Convoy, many more donations were being made with traditional crowd funding platforms. This would soon change.

- February 5, 2022: [GoFundMe announced](https://twitter.com/gofundme/status/1489870510057877505?s=20&t=yIaTuK2kbAmCC1CL6FTaQw) that all donations to the Freedom Convoy would be refunded to the donors, banning any further involvement between the crowd funding platform and the Freedom Convoy. This was essentially an advertisement for unstoppable money like Bitcoin. Donations to the [@HonkHonkHodl](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl) fundraising campaign through [@tallycoinapp](https://twitter.com/tallycoinapp) started to ramp up.

- February 7, 2022: Under an [order](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/freedom-convoy-2022-donations-frozen-give-send-go-1.6347345) issued by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, another crowd funding platform, [@GiveSendGo](https://twitter.com/GiveSendGo) was compelled to freeze access to millions of dollars donated to the Freedom Convoy. [Official statement](https://givesendgo.com/site/pressrelease). This further escalated fundraising via Bitcoin through the [@HonkHonkHodl](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl) fundraising campaign. 

- February 11, 2022: Ontario [declares](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-announcement-ontario-protests-1.6347810) state of emergency. This declaration explicitly made it "illegal and punishable to block and impede the movement of goods, people and services along critical infrastructure". Further clarifying that "Fines for non-compliance will be severe, with a maximum penalty of $100,000 and up to a year imprisonment. We will also provide additional authority to consider taking away the personal and commercial licences of anyone who doesn't comply with these orders".

- February 14, 2022: Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau [invoked](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-premiers-cabinet-1.6350734) the Emergencies Act. Among expanding the powers and reach of the Canadian government beyond that which may not be appropriate in normal times, the Emergencies Act had two specific and sweeping financial implications. First, this would capture crowd funding platforms and payment service providers under the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act. Second, crowd funding platforms and the payment service providers they use had to register with and report large and/or suspicious transactions to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), the national financial intelligence agency.

- February 14, 2022: The same day the Canadian government invoked the Emergencies Act, [@HonkHonkHodl](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl) closed out the fundraising campaign on [@tallycoinapp](https://twitter.com/tallycoinapp), having exceeded their original goal, reaching nearly 21 bitcoin in total donation.

- February 15, 2022: The Ontario Superior Court of Justice inacted the [Mareva Injunction](https://ottawaconvoyclassaction.ca/order-mareva.pdf), a $306,000,000 class action law suit. This injunction named 17 individuals, 2 organizations, and 62 anonymous entities as defendants further stipulating that "Any other person who knows of this order and does anything which helps or permits the Defendant to breach the terms of this Order may also be held to be in contempt of court and may be fined or imprisoned". Essentially, anyone who did so much as [serve coffee](https://twitter.com/Ranting4Canada/status/1495471835420450816?s=20&t=h49vUtxlCn-6s__PI9vfXg) to a Freedom Convoy suspect would face fines and imprisonment. This injuction goes as far as to include several Bitcoin addresses, so if one of these ends up in connection with your identity then you would be in violation of this injuction.   

- February 16, 2022: [News broke](https://twitter.com/nobsbitcoin/status/1493978391099457536?s=20&t=3OffQxFJg4Y0qIy9vi_RAg) that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) publish a blacklist of cryptocurrency addresses related to the Freedom Convoy donations. Essentially, this meant that any funds connected to any of these addresses hitting a bitcoin-to-fiat off ramp would trigger seizure and immediate reporting to authorities based on the emergency measures put in place just days prior.
