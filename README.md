# Three ways to Whirlpool
All Bitcoin transactions are public, anyone can look at them. Whirlpool breaks deterministic links to past transactions and provides forward-looking anonymity. This guide will explain three easy ways to Whirlpool your bitcoin so that you can preserve the censorship-resistant and permissionless attributes of Bitcoin.

## Background:
There is nothing special required to view every Bitcoin transaction that has ever occured, they are all publicly available on the blockchain. You don't need a node, just a simple block explorer website will do; such as [Mempool.space](https://mempool.space/), [KYCP.org](https://kycp.org/#/), or [Blockstream Explorer](https://blockstream.info/). 

What isn't stored on the blockchain is your personally identifying details such as name, address, phone number, etc. That information is cataloged externally by third parties such as your employer, your brokerage/exchange, or possibly a fundraiser you donated to and volunteered that information to. If your employer paid you in Bitcoin then they would be able to follow your public transactions and see that you made a donation to a fundraiser, for example. Likewise, the organizer of the fundraiser would be able to see the history of your Bitcoin transactions and they would know how much bitcoin you had going into the transaction where you sliced off a small portion to donate. 

Further more, any external observer who knew what the Bitcoin donation address was, would be able to monitor all incomining donations and then see where the remaining change from those donations was sent to. These external observers could also see where the donations went after the initial deposit. If there was any personally identifying information held by a trusted third party where fiat was traded for bitcoin or where bitcoin was traded for fiat, then the custodian of that information will be compelled to turn over those details that personally identify an idividual. 

## A Real-World Example:
Take the recent Canadian Freedom Convoy for instance, here is a timeline of actual events with a hypothetical character, Alice, to preserve the privacy of anyone who actually participated.

- January 28, 2022: Truckers start arriving in Ottawa, ON
- February 1, 2022: [@HonkHonkHodl](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl) receives first bitcoin donation via [@tallycoinapp](https://twitter.com/tallycoinapp). ([Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl/status/1488625113406717952?s=20&t=3OffQxFJg4Y0qIy9vi_RAg)).

Now, I may be going out on limb here, but stick with me through this totally hypothetical scenario. Imagine a world where your government takes issue with a particular fundraiser, so much so that the government declares emergency measures to expand their reach and they compell the companies handling the donations to seize the funds. Then image that the government, with its new expanded powers under the emergency measures, has the ability to warrentlessly obtain information related to you for making a donation to the fundraiser. Equipped with this information, imagine that this government could catagorize the participants of the cause as terrorists and that by proxy you, who attempted to donate to the cause, is then in violation of the government's laws for terrorist financing. Resulting in warrantless search and seizure of all assets including bank accounts, brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, property titles, and more.
