# Three ways to Whirlpool
All Bitcoin transactions are public, anyone can look at them. Whirlpool breaks deterministic links to past transactions and provides forward-looking anonymity. This guide will explain three easy ways to Whirlpool your bitcoin so that you can preserve the censorship-resistant and permissionless attributes of Bitcoin.

## Background:
There is nothing special required to view every Bitcoin transaction that has ever occured, they are all publicly available on the blockchain. You don't need a node, just a simple block explorer website will do; such as [Mempool.space](https://mempool.space/), [KYCP.org](https://kycp.org/#/), or [Blockstream Explorer](https://blockstream.info/). 

What isn't stored on the blockchain is your personally identifying details such as name, address, phone number, etc. That information is cataloged externally by third parties such as your employer, your brokerage/exchange, or possibly a fundraiser you donated to and volunteered that information to. If your employer paid you in Bitcoin then they would be able to follow your public transactions and see that you made a donation to a fundraiser, for example. Likewise, the organizer of the fundraiser would be able to see the history of your Bitcoin transactions and they would know how much bitcoin you had going into the transaction where you sliced off a small portion to donate. 

Further more, any external observer who knew what the Bitcoin donation address was, would be able to monitor all incomining donations and then see where the remaining change from those donations was sent to. These external observers could also see where the donations went after the initial deposit. If there was any personally identifying information held by a trusted third party where fiat was traded for bitcoin or where bitcoin was traded for fiat, then the custodian of that information will be compelled to turn over those details that personally identify an idividual. 

## A Real-World Example:
Before diving into how Whirlpool works, it is helpful to understand the implications of a fully transparant transaction ledger in the face of an ever increasingly adversarial world. This section will provide that background with a real-world example and an explaination of how bitcoin transaction are scrutinized in such a scenario using a ficticious character, Alice, to preserve the privacy of tose actually involved.

Take the recent Canadian Freedom Convoy for instance, here is a timeline of actual events with a hypothetical character, Alice, to preserve the privacy of anyone who actually participated.

- January 28, 2022: Truckers start arriving in Ottawa, ON
- February 1, 2022: [@HonkHonkHodl](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl) receives first bitcoin donation via [@tallycoinapp](https://twitter.com/tallycoinapp). ([Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl/status/1488625113406717952?s=20&t=3OffQxFJg4Y0qIy9vi_RAg)). Not many people were using Bitcoin to donate to the Freedom Convoy, many more donations were being made with traditional crowd funding platforms. This would soon change.

- February 5, 2022: [GoFundMe announced](https://twitter.com/gofundme/status/1489870510057877505?s=20&t=yIaTuK2kbAmCC1CL6FTaQw) that all donations to the Freedom Convoy would be refunded to the donors, banning any further involvement between the crowd funding platform and the Freedom Convoy. This was essentially an advertisement for unstoppable money like Bitcoin. Donations to the [@HonkHonkHodl](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl) fundraising campaign through [@tallycoinapp](https://twitter.com/tallycoinapp) started to ramp up.

- February 7, 2022: Under an [order](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/freedom-convoy-2022-donations-frozen-give-send-go-1.6347345) issued by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, another crowd funding platform, [@GiveSendGo](https://twitter.com/GiveSendGo) was compelled to freeze access to millions of dollars donated to the Freedom Convoy. [Official statement](https://givesendgo.com/site/pressrelease). This further escalated fundraising via Bitcoin through the [@HonkHonkHodl](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl) fundraising campaign. 

- February 11, 2022: Ontario [declares](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-announcement-ontario-protests-1.6347810) state of emergency. This declaration explicitly made it "illegal and punishable to block and impede the movement of goods, people and services along critical infrastructure". Further clarifying that "Fines for non-compliance will be severe, with a maximum penalty of $100,000 and up to a year imprisonment. We will also provide additional authority to consider taking away the personal and commercial licences of anyone who doesn't comply with these orders".

- February 14, 2022: Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau [invoked](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-premiers-cabinet-1.6350734) the Emergencies Act. Among expanding the powers and reach of the Canadian government beyond that which may not be appropriate in normal times, the Emergencies Act had two specific and sweeping financial implications. First, this would capture crowd funding platforms and payment service providers under the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act. Second, crowd funding platforms and the payment service providers they use had to register with and report large and/or suspicious transactions to the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), the national financial intelligence agency.

- February 14, 2022: The same day the Canadian government invoked the Emergencies Act, [@HonkHonkHodl](https://twitter.com/HonkHonkHodl) closed out the fundraising campaign on [@tallycoinapp](https://twitter.com/tallycoinapp), having exceeded their original goal, reaching nearly 21 bitcoin in total donation.
